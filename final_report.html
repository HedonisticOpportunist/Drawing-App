      <h2>EXTENSIONS</h2>

      <p>
      <h3>3D TOOL</h3>
      </p>
      <p>The 3D tool creates buffer graphics which are saved as an image to the canvas; the buffer includes the WEBGL
            canvas created separately for this extension. The canvas for the 3D drawing is 400 by 400, and its
            background colour can be changed via the colour palette. In order to avoid memory leaks, the 3D tool imposes
            limits on how many sketches can be drawn before reloading the application.
      </p>

      <p>
      <h3>ANIMATION TOOL</h3>
      </p>

      <p>The animation tool can either draw sprites or to load images as a sequence of animations on the canvas. There
            are three available animations to choose from. Upon selection of an animation, a compound boolean condition
            is triggered that then selects an event handler from the helper function in order to display the animation
            on the canvas. </p>

      <p>
      <h3>CROPPING TOOL</h3>
      </p>

      <p>The cropping tool selects an area via the mouse coordinates and then draws a beige background on the screen
            once the cut button has been clicked. The mouse click event is handled in the helper function.
      </p>

      <p>
      <h3>ERASER TOOL</h3>
      </p>

      <p>The eraser tool draws a line over a selected area via mouse coordinates. The stroke weight can be with the
            slider. The colour of the eraser is the same as the background colour, unless the screen has been cleared or
            the console has selected.</p>

      <p>
      <h3>GEOMETRIC SHAPES TOOL</h3>
      </p>

      <p>
            Geometric shapes can be selected from the images displayed in the div options field. Upon selection, the
            position of the shape is determined via mouse coordinates. The stroke weight of the shape is set by the
            slider. The colour of the shape can either be selected via the colour palette or by clicking on a button
            that displays a random hex colour.
