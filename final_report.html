         <p>I used the following third libraries to help enhance my project or implement certain features: https://iro.js.org/ (colour palette)</p>
         <ul>
         <li>https://iro.js.org/ (colour palette)</li>
         <li>https://github.com/generative-light/p5.scribble.js (squiggly / wiggly shapes)</li>
         <li>https://github.com/gaba5/p5.shape.js (more shape options)</li>
         <li>http://molleindustria.github.io/p5.play/ (loading animations and drawing sprites)</li>
         </ul>
         <h2>== IMAGE CREDITS ==</h2>
         <p>The images used throughout the site were mostly found on https://www.flaticon.com/authors/flat-icons. I have also created a html page entitled &lsquo;icon_credits&rsquo; within the app itself to address any further credits for images / animations used throughout the project.</p>
         <h2>== HTML AND CSS ==</h2>
         <p> In order to incorporate items such as the gradient button, I used the code from https://codepen.io/pirrera/pen/bqVeGx which I modified slightly to use my needs. 
         </p>
         <p>Another piece of css, I modified slightly is the code for the horizontal tab on the icon credits and help pages. The css code came from: https://css-tricks.com/examples/hrs/ 
         </p>
         <p>The slider was implemented using: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_rangeslider.asp which I also customised to further fit in with the rest of the application&rsquo;s appearance.

         <h2> == JS CODE ==  </h2>

         In order to generate hex colours, I implemented a getRandomColour method in the drawingHelpers file. The code was found here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1484506/random-color-generator
